      <p className='text-gray-700 mb-4'>The Privacy Act 1988 (Cth) ("Privacy Act") defines types of information, including Personal Information and Sensitive Information.</p>

      <p className='text-gray-700 mb-4'>
        If the information does not disclose your identity or enable your identity to be ascertained, it will in most cases not be classified as "Personal Information" and will not be subject to this Privacy Policy.
      </p>
 
      <h3 className='text-xl font-medium mb-2'>(b) Sensitive Information</h3>
      <p className='text-gray-700 mb-4'>Sensitive Information is defined in the Privacy Act as including information or opinion about such things as an individual's:</p>

      <p className='text-gray-700 mb-4'>(c) By using our Website, you consent to the receipt of direct marketing material. We will only use your Personal Information for this purpose if we have collected such information directly from you, and if it is material of a type which you would reasonably expect to receive from us.

Our direct marketing material will include a simple means by which you can request not to receive further communications of this nature, such as an unsubscribe link.</p>

      <p className='text-gray-700 mb-4'>(a) We store your Personal Information in a way that reasonably protects it from unauthorised access, misuse, modification or disclosure.</p>
      <p className='text-gray-700 mb-4'>(b) When we no longer require your Personal Information for the purpose for which we obtained it, we will take reasonable steps to destroy or anonymise or de-identify it. Most of the Personal Information that is stored in our client files and records will be kept for a maximum of seven (7) years to fulfill our record keeping obligations.</p>

      <h2 className='text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4'>7. Overseas Transfer</h2>
      <p className='text-gray-700 mb-4'>Your Personal Information may be transferred overseas or stored overseas for a variety of reasons. It is not possible to identify each and every country to which your Personal Information may be sent.</p>
      <p className='text-gray-700 mb-4'>If your Personal Information is sent to a recipient in a country with data protection laws which are at least substantially similar to the Australian Privacy Principles, and where there are mechanisms available to you to enforce protection of your Personal Information under that overseas law, we will not be liable for a breach of the Australian Privacy Principles if your Personal Information is mishandled in that jurisdiction.</p>
      <p className='text-gray-700 mb-4'>If your Personal Information is transferred to a jurisdiction which does not have data protection laws as comprehensive as Australia's, we will take reasonable steps to secure a contractual commitment from the recipient to handle your information in accordance with the Australian Privacy Principles.</p>
